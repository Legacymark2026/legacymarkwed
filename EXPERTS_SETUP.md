# Experts Dashboard - Setup Guide

## Cloudinary Configuration

### 1. Create a Cloudinary Account
1. Go to [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com) and sign up for a free account
2. After signing in, go to your Dashboard
3. Copy your "Cloud Name" (e.g., `dxyz123abc`)

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Add this to your `.env` file:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="your-cloud-name-here"
```

### 3. Set Up Upload Preset (Optional)
The app uses Cloudinary's default `ml_default` preset, but you can create a custom one:
1. Go to Settings → Upload → Upload presets
2. Create a new "Unsigned" preset
3. Update `components/ui/image-upload.tsx` to use your preset name

## Database Seeding

To populate your database with sample experts for testing:

```bash
npx tsx prisma/seed.ts
```

This will create 3 sample experts with:
- Professional bios
- Social media links  
- Placeholder images (using UI Avatars API)

npm run dev
