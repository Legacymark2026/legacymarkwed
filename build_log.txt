⚠ Warning: Next.js inferred your workspace root, but it may not be correct.
 We detected multiple lockfiles and selected the directory of C:\Users\hboho\package-lock.json as the root directory.
 To silence this warning, set `turbopack.root` in your Next.js config, or consider removing one of the lockfiles if it's not needed.

Error: Turbopack build failed with 1 errors:
./.gemini/antigravity/scratch/legacymark/proxy.ts:2:1
Export authConfig doesn't exist in target module
  1 | import { NextRequest } from "next/server";

    | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  3 | import NextAuth from "next-auth";

  5 | // Use the authorized callback from authConfig

The export authConfig was not found in module [project]/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/legacymark/lib/auth.ts [middleware] (ecmascript).
Did you mean to import auth?
All exports of the module are statically known (It doesn't have dynamic exports). So it's known statically that the requested export doesn't exist.
